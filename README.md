## Hello ãƒ„

Thanks for checking out [my website](http://nsmo.info/). Here's how I build my website:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) graciously hosts my site.
- [Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets (a.k.a Sass)](http://sass-lang.com) help make it pretty.
- My blog posts are written in [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html).
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) does just about everything else.
